    "response": "Cryptocurrency (crypto) is digital or virtual money secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptos operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. Bitcoin was the first crypto, created in 2009, and since then thousands of cryptocurrencies have emerged. Key features include: decentralization (no central authority), transparency (public ledgers), security (cryptographic protection), and global accessibility (24/7 trading).",

    "response": "Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's first and most well-known cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It's often called 'digital gold' because: 1) Limited supply of 21 million coins, 2) Store of value properties, 3) Decentralized nature, 4) Peer-to-peer transactions without banks. Bitcoin runs on a blockchain network secured by miners who validate transactions. Its value fluctuates based on supply, demand, adoption, and market sentiment.",

    "response": "Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum goes beyond simple transactions - it's a programmable blockchain. Key features: 1) Smart contracts (self-executing contracts), 2) DApp platform, 3) Native currency (Ether/ETH), 4) Proof-of-Stake consensus (after 'The Merge' upgrade). Ethereum hosts thousands of projects including DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other innovations. It's often called the 'world computer' due to its programmability.",

Price factors include: institutional adoption, regulatory news, market sentiment, supply/demand dynamics, and macroeconomic factors. For real-time prices, I recommend checking reliable exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or price tracking sites like CoinGecko.

  {
    "user_input": "how does blockchain work",
    "response": "Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. Here's how it works: 1) Transactions are grouped into 'blocks', 2) Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a 'chain', 3) Network participants (nodes) validate transactions, 4) Once verified, blocks are added to the chain permanently, 5) The ledger is distributed across thousands of computers globally. This creates immutability (can't be changed), transparency (publicly verifiable), and decentralization (no single point of control).",
