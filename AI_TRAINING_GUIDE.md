# Krypt AI Training Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to enhance and train the Krypt AI chatbot for better cryptocurrency analysis and conversation.

## Current Features

### 1. Greeting Detection
- Properly identifies greetings like "hi", "hello", "hey"
- Prevents false matches with crypto names containing "hi" (like Shiba Inu)
- Returns friendly welcome messages

### 2. Crypto Query Processing
- Extracts cryptocurrency names from user input
- Maps common symbols (BTC → Bitcoin, ETH → Ethereum)
- Provides real-time price and market data
- Displays 24h price changes and market cap

### 3. Intelligent Search
- Prevents greeting words from triggering crypto searches
- Uses exact matches first, then intelligent substring matching
- Excludes common words to avoid false positives

## Training the PyTorch Model

### 1. Conversation Dataset
Create training data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "training_data": [
    {
      "input": "hello",
      "output": "Hello! I can help you with cryptocurrency analysis.",
      "type": "greeting"
    },
    {
      "input": "bitcoin price",
      "output": "Let me get the current Bitcoin price for you.",
      "type": "crypto_query"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Model Architecture
Current implementation uses:
- Sequence-to-Sequence model with GRU layers
- Embedding layers for text processing
- Pattern matching for immediate responses

### 3. Training Process
```python
# Example training setup
def train_model():
    # Load training data
    dataset = load_conversation_dataset()
    
    # Create data loader
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
    
    # Initialize model and optimizer
    model = Seq2SeqModel(vocab_size, hidden_dim, output_dim)
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for batch in dataloader:
            # Forward pass and backpropagation
            pass
```

## Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Sentiment Analysis Integration
- Analyze news sentiment for better investment insights
- Combine with price data for comprehensive analysis
- Provide risk assessments

### 2. Technical Analysis
- Add support for chart pattern recognition
- Implement moving averages and technical indicators
- Provide buy/sell signals (with disclaimers)

### 3. Portfolio Management
- Track user portfolios (if implemented)
- Provide performance analytics
- Risk management suggestions

### 4. Market News Integration
- Real-time news summarization
- Filter news by relevance and impact
- Provide market movement explanations

## Testing Your Enhancements

### 1. Unit Tests
```python
def test_greeting_detection():
    assert chatbot.is_greeting("hi") == True
    assert chatbot.is_greeting("bitcoin") == False
    assert chatbot.is_greeting("hello there") == True
```

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test with live market data
- Verify response quality
- Check for false positives/negatives

### 3. User Acceptance Testing
- Test with real user queries
- Monitor conversation flow
- Gather feedback for improvements

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Caching
- Cache market data (5-minute TTL)
- Cache news data
- Store frequent query results

### 2. Response Time
- Optimize API calls
- Implement async processing where possible
- Minimize model inference time

### 3. Accuracy Improvements
- Regular model retraining
- A/B testing of responses
- User feedback integration

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Model Versioning
- Keep track of model versions
- Implement rollback capabilities
- Monitor performance metrics

### 2. Scaling
- Consider model serving infrastructure
- Implement load balancing
- Monitor resource usage

### 3. Monitoring
- Track conversation success rates
- Monitor for inappropriate responses
- Log errors for debugging

## Contributing

When enhancing the AI features:

1. Test thoroughly with various inputs
2. Maintain the disclaimer system for investment advice
3. Ensure responses are helpful and accurate
4. Consider edge cases and error handling
5. Document any new features or changes

## Security and Compliance

- Never provide specific investment advice
- Always include risk disclaimers
- Protect user privacy
- Comply with financial regulations
- Monitor for potential misuse
