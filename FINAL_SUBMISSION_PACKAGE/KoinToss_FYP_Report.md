    magnitude1 = sum(a * a for a in vec1) ** 0.5
    magnitude2 = sum(b * b for b in vec2) ** 0.5
    
    if magnitude1 == 0 or magnitude2 == 0:
        return 0
    
    return dot_product / (magnitude1 * magnitude2)

def text_to_vector(text, vocabulary):
    """Convert text to vector representation"""
    words = tokenize_text(text.lower())
    vector = [words.count(word) for word in vocabulary]
    return vector
```
