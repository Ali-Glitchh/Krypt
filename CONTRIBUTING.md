### üîß Code Contributions
Ready to write some code? Follow these steps:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic knowledge of FastAPI, REST APIs, and Python
- Understanding of embeddable widgets and JavaScript (for frontend integration)

### Development Setup
```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kointoss-crypto-chatbot.git
cd kointoss-crypto-chatbot

# 3. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Install development dependencies (if available)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 6. Run the production verification test
python production_verification_test.py

# 7. Start the autonomous training system
python start_autonomous_training.py

# 8. In another terminal, start the API server
python enhanced_kointoss_api_server.py

# 9. Test the embeddable widget at http://localhost:8000/widget
```

## üìã Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch
```bash
# Create a new branch for your feature/fix
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/your-bugfix-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update docstrings for new functions

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run production verification test
python production_verification_test.py

# Run core tests
python test_core_components.py

# Test enhanced features
python test_enhanced_features.py

# Run complete verification
python final_verification_complete.py

# Test the API server
python enhanced_kointoss_api_server.py --reload

# Test autonomous training
python start_autonomous_training.py
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add real-time price alerts for portfolio tracking"

# Use conventional commit format:
# feat: new feature
# fix: bug fix
# docs: documentation
# style: formatting
# refactor: code restructuring
# test: adding tests
# chore: maintenance
```

### 5. Push and Create PR
```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
# Include a clear description of your changes
```

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where possible
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Example Code Structure
```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

def process_crypto_data(
    coin_id: str, 
    include_market_data: bool = True
) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Process cryptocurrency data for the chatbot.
    
    Args:
        coin_id: The cryptocurrency identifier
        include_market_data: Whether to include market statistics
        
    Returns:
        Processed crypto data or None if error
    """
    try:
        # Implementation here
        return processed_data
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing {coin_id}: {e}")
        return None
```

### FastAPI Components
- Use consistent naming for API endpoints
- Add comprehensive error handling for all routes
- Implement proper request/response validation with Pydantic
- Include rate limiting and security considerations
- Add comprehensive documentation with examples

### Embeddable Widget Guidelines
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no external dependencies)
- Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- Follow accessibility guidelines (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Use consistent CSS naming conventions with kointoss- prefix

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Adding Tests
When adding new features, please include tests:

```python
def test_new_feature():
    """Test description"""
    # Arrange
    input_data = "test input"
    
    # Act
    result = your_function(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result is not None
    assert "expected" in result
```

- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **API Tests**: Test REST API endpoints and WebSocket connections
- **Widget Tests**: Test embeddable widget functionality
- **Training Tests**: Test autonomous learning system
- **Production Tests**: Comprehensive production readiness verification

## üìù Documentation
